##Quick Start

This section will get you up and running with LoopBack and the StrongLoop sample app in just a few minutes.

1. If you have not already done so, download and install [StrongLoop Suite](http://www.strongloop.com/get-started) or set up your cloud development platform.

2. Setup the StrongLoop Suite sample app with this command.
```sh
$ slc example
```
This command clones the sample app into a new directory
named `sls-sample-app` and installs all of its dependencies.
3. Run the sample application by entering this command:
```sh
$ cd sls-sample-app
$ slc run app
```
4. To see the app running in a browser, open <http://localhost:3000>. The app homepage lists sample requests you can make against the LoopBack REST API.
<a href="http://localhost:3000/" class="status btn btn-primary">View the Sample App</a>
5. To browse all the sample app's REST APIs, open the API explorer at <http://localhost:3000/explorer>.
<a href="http://localhost:3000/explorer" class="status btn btn-primary">View the API Explorer</a>
