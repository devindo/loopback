##Quick Start

This section will get you up and running with LoopBack and the StrongLoop sample app in just a few minutes.

1. If you have not already done so, download and install [StrongLoop Suite](http://www.strongloop.com/get-started) or set up your cloud development platform.

2. Setup the StrongLoop Suite sample app with these commands.

```sh
$ slc example
```

This command clones the sample app into a new directory
named `sls-sample-app` and installs all of its dependencies.

3. Run the sample application by entering this command:

```sh
$ cd sls-sample-app
$ slc run app
```

4. Open the app in a browser.

The sample app should now be running at <a href="http://localhost:3000" target="_blank">http://localhost:3000</a>. The homepage of
the sample app lists several sample requests you can make against the LoopBack
REST API.

<a href="http://localhost:3000" class="status btn btn-primary" target="_blank">

5. Explore the REST API

To browse all the sample app's REST APIs,
[open the API explorer](http://localhost:3000/explorer)

<a href="http://localhost:3000/explorer" class="status btn btn-primary">View the
API Explorer</a>
